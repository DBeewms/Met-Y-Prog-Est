## Repository Description

### C#, Console, and Windows Forms Exercises

This repository contains a series of practical exercises and examples that will help you understand the basics of structured programming methodology and its implementation in C#. The exercises are developed using two different environments:

- **Console**: Console application for basic exercises and quick testing.
- **Windows Forms**: Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) for more complex applications.

---

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

**Examples**: Contains basic code examples in C# using Console and Windows Forms. Simple problems to understand the structure of a program.

**Practical Exercises**: Includes a series of solved exercises and challenges for you to practice. More complex challenges to help you improve your structured programming skills.

---

## Code Examples

Below is a basic code example in each environment:

### Console (C#)

```Console (C#)
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World in C# (Console)!");
    }
}
```

### Windows Forms (C#)

```Windows Forms (C#)
using System.Windows.Forms;

namespace HelloWorldWindowsForms
{
    public partial class Form1 : Form
    {
        public Form1()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }

        private void btnGreet_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            MessageBox.Show("Hello, World in C# (Windows Forms)!");
        }
    }
}
```
